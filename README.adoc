== SSH-Key generator 

Starting the container using

[source]
docker run -v /tmp/:/sshkey ssh-keygen

will create a key on the host in /tmp.

NOTE: this has a issue on docker for windows. since the windows host volume is mounted by smb to the container. you will loose your permissions set to the ssh key. Use docker data container instead to workaround.

=== Environment Variables

[options=header]
|======================
|Name|default
|KEY_GEN_PATH|/sshkey
|======================

=== Example with docker data container

Here is a example for docker data container. This will create a container named keystore and a docker data volume /root/.ssh.
Use environment variable KEY_GEN_PATH to override the default location. The ssh key is now stored within the docker data container.

[source]
docker run -v /root/.ssh -e KEY_GEN_PATH=/root/.ssh --name keystore ssh-keygen
